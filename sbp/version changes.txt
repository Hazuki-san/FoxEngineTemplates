Just a file that details all the changes to the template with every new
version. This is only for looking back at the progress we've made (and
hopefully find bugs more easily)!

[2022-Aug-2]:
+ Renamed the "SoundEffect" object to "Custom", which is its true name
- Removed the version names from the template
- Removed all the empty indent lines
+ Improved Sound object parsing based on integration demo code
+ Commented out Music Segment parsing code since it broke parsing
+ Fixed Actor-Mixer parsing
+ RTPC unknowns are now properly named

[2021-Nov-11]:
+ Commented broken parsing code for Music Playlist Containers
- Removed some broken parsing code for Music Playlist Containers

[?]:
+ Declared the startOfSection local variable as a long

[2021-Nov-4]:
+ Fix to the printing of the sound structure parent
+ Added another print for the output bus ID in the sound structure
+ Added a use transition segment print in the music switch container
+ Implemented a check for is_game_soundbank so that the parsing doesn't
break for objects that were generated by KJP's modified WWise tool
+ Added an else statement for the action type in an event action
+ Fixed some parsing problems for Music Segments & greatly improved parsing for them
+ Implemented the is_game_soundbank check for Music Switch Containers

[2021-Oct-17]:
+ Added parsing for music switch containers.
+ Moved some commonly used structs from soundstructure.bt to common.bt.
+ Added a break to the music segment, because the results after that
are not good.
+ Added an HDR_enable_envelope boolean that was missing from the sound
structure.

[2021-Oct-12]:
+ Added parsing for Auxiliary Busses.
+ Organized the States struct so that it's more readable.

[2021-Oct-12]:
+ Added sound structure parsing for sequence containers, blend
containers and switch containers.
+ Organized the last for loop in States so that both uints are inside
their own struct.
+ Organized the General_Settings struct so it looks & works better.
+ Implemented some code in the sound structure that accounts for the zero
latency check box when a sound is streamed.
+ Added a check in the sound structure for the "flagsUnknown" so that 4
bytes are skipped when flag #1 (starting from 0) is enabled.
+ Added parsing for Audio Busses.
+ Added missing Voice_Pitch setting for Y_Axis_Effect_Type in RTPCs.
+ Added missing GeneralSettingsAudioBusVolume setting for audio busses.

[2021-Sep-24]:
+ Another tiny upgrade to the actor mixer. Now it parses the first section
as a sound structure, which appears to properly parse a big part of the
object now!

[2021-Sep-24]:
+ Tiny update to the actor-mixer parsing, so that it (hopefully) shows the
parent object ID as it should.

[2021-Sep-21]:
+ Massive upgrade to the sound structure. Now the template parses it much,
much better than before.
+ Renamed the 'Unknown' object type to 'SoundEffect', since Wwise always
automatically creates this object when a sound/music segment has an
effect applied on it.
+ Added an FSKip(4) to the music segment/music switch container after it
declares a sound structure, just so that it parses properly (for now at
least).
