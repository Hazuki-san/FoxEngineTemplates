Just a file that details all the changes to the template with every new
version. This is only for looking back at the progress we've made (and
hopefully find bugs more easily)!

Version 2.6 [21-10-17]:
+ Added parsing for music switch containers.
+ Moved some commonly used structs from soundstructure.bt to common.bt.
+ Added a break to the music segment, because the results after that
are not good.

Version 2.5.5 [21-10-12]:
+ Added parsing for Auxiliary Busses.
+ Organized the States struct so that it's more readable.

Version 2.5 [21-10-12]:
+ Added sound structure parsing for sequence containers, blend
containers and switch containers.
+ Organized the last for loop in States so that both uints are inside
their own struct.
+ Organized the General_Settings struct so it looks & works better.
+ Implemented some code in the sound structure that accounts for the zero
latency check box when a sound is streamed.
+ Added a check in the sound structure for the "flagsUnknown" so that 4
bytes are skipped when flag #1 (starting from 0) is enabled.
+ Added parsing for Audio Busses.
+ Added missing Voice_Pitch setting for Y_Axis_Effect_Type in RTPCs.
+ Added missing GeneralSettingsAudioBusVolume setting for audio busses.

Version 2.4.2:
+ Another tiny upgrade to the actor mixer. Now it parses the first section
as a sound structure, which appears to properly parse a big part of the
object now!

Version 2.4.1:
+ Tiny update to the actor-mixer parsing, so that it (hopefully) shows the
parent object ID as it should.

Version 2.4:
+ Massive upgrade to the sound structure. Now the template parses it much,
much better than before.
+ Renamed the 'Unknown' object type to 'SoundEffect', since Wwise always
automatically creates this object when a sound/music segment has an
effect applied on it.
+ Added an FSKip(4) to the music segment/music switch container after it
declares a sound structure, just so that it parses properly (for now at
least).
