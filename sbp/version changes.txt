Just a file that details all the changes to the template with every new
version. This is only for looking back at the progress we've made (and
hopefully find bugs more easily)!

Version 2.4.1:
+ Tiny update to the actor-mixer parsing, so that it (hopefully) shows the
parent object ID as it should.

Version 2.4:
+ Massive upgrade to the sound structure. Now the template parses it much,
much better than before.
+ Renamed the 'Unknown' object type to 'SoundEffect', since Wwise always
automatically creates this object when a sound/music segment has an
effect applied on it.
+ Added an FSKip(4) to the music segment/music switch container after it
declares a sound structure, just so that it parses properly (for now at
least).
